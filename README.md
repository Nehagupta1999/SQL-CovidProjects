# COVID-19 Data Analysis with SQL

# Description:

This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL queries. The dataset includes global COVID-19 statistics, such as confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination rates across different countries and regions. The objective of this analysis is to uncover insights and trends in the spread of COVID-19, the impact on various countries, and the correlation between vaccinations and case rates. 
The project uses SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and querying large datasets to generate useful insights. It demonstrates the power of SQL in handling large, complex datasets and provides meaningful outputs to inform decision-making processes related to the pandemic.

Key Features and Analysis: 

•	Data Extraction and Transformation: Extracted and cleaned COVID-19 data from multiple sources (e.g., government databases or APIs). 

•	Trend Analysis: Used SQL queries to analyze trends over time, such as the growth rate of cases, deaths, and recoveries by region or country. 

•	Comparison: Analyzed and compared case numbers across different countries, examining factors like population density, vaccination rates, and government responses. 

•	Correlation Studies: Investigated correlations between vaccination rates and the reduction in case numbers or deaths. 

Technologies Used: 

•	SQL (Structured Query Language) 

•	MySQL or PostgreSQL (database management systems) 

•	Data Sources: Open COVID-19 databases (e.g., Johns Hopkins, World Health Organization)
